# PHP-Trivia-Game

For Project 2, our group will primarily utilize HTML, CSS, and PHP to create our version of the popular game show "Who Wants to be a Millionaire?".

This project is broken up into four main parts (full diagram can be seen in this repository):
  1. Login/Register using PHP
  2. Questions (10 in total)
  3. Winner/Loser page (based on user answers to the questions)
  4. Leaderboard
  
This project should satisfy the following criteria:
  1. Cookies/Sessions (Login/Register)
  2. Form Processing (Questions take input and process the user's answers)
  3. Logins for registration and users (Login/Register)
  4. Implementation of logic used (See diagram for site logic)
